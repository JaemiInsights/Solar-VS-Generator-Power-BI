🔋 Solar vs Generator Energy Report – Power BI Dashboard

This project is a data analysis and visualization report that compares **Solar** and **Generator** energy sources. It highlights the **cost**, **uptime**, and **environmental impact** (CO₂ emissions) across **households** and **businesses** in different regions.

The analysis was built in **Power BI**, and this report is part of my portfolio as an aspiring Data Analyst.

<h2 style="color:red">🧠 Project Objective</h2>

To help decision-makers (e.g., homeowners, business owners, policymakers) understand:
- Which energy source is more **cost-effective**
- Which source has better **performance (uptime)**
- The **environmental trade-offs** (emissions)

<h2 style="color:red">📌 Key Insights</h2>

- 🔋 **Solar energy is significantly cheaper** both monthly and over 5 years 
- 🌱 **Generators produce high CO₂ emissions**, while solar produces none 
- 🧾 **Businesses using generators spend the most** — switching to solar could cut costs 
- 📈 **Uptime is slightly better with generators**, but the difference is small 
- 🗺️ **Some regions show stronger solar performance**, making it ideal for targeted investment 

---

<h2 style="color:red">📝 Summary Recommendation</h2>

> Based on this analysis, **Solar energy is the better long-term solution**. It is:
> - More **cost-effective**
> - **Environmentally friendly**
> - Nearly equal in uptime compared to generators 
> 
> Although generators offer slightly higher uptime, they are more expensive and emit harmful CO₂. Solar is the **recommended energy choice** for households and businesses.
